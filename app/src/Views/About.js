				<h2>About Us</h2>
				<h3>What</h3>
				<p>
					Our golf association is comprised of both 9 hole and 18 hole clubs. The 9 hole club will play weekly
					on Tuesday evenings and the 18 hole club plays typically every other Saturday.  Our event calendar
					lists the actual dates of play for each club. There is also a 9 hole open play Thursday morning
					option.  There are no club events held on Thursday mornings, unless you and your group decide to play
					something on the side. Our golf season runs from April to October, weather permitting. We welcome all
					women golfers--you do not need to reside in the city of Brooklyn Park to join Edinburgh USA Women’s
					Golf Association.
				</p>

				<h3>Who</h3>
				<p>
					We are a very diverse group of women golfers, with a wide range of abilities but we all have one
					common factor:  We LOVE the game of golf. In our association, there is something available for all
					players, whether you are looking for competitive golf, socializing, or just getting out and playing
					the game. Edinburgh USA is a challenging but fun course with a lot of hazards (both sand and water).
					The unique feature of our association is that you are not required to play in every event.
					Registration is on an event by event basis—so you can participate as your schedule allows.
				</p>

				<h3>Where & When</h3>
				<p>
					We not only offer tournaments and events, we also schedule a summer Day Trip Golf Outing, an
					Invitational/Guest Day, and several social events. We hope by joining EWGA, you will formulate
					lasting friendships with women who share your love of this game.
				</p>

				<p>
					In 2014 our course completed an amazing renovation including all new bunkers, removal of several
					trees, and more playable area around the greens. We truly believe we have one of the best courses in
					the state! Joining the Edinburgh USA Women’s Golf Association will give you the opportunity to play
					a truly delightful championship course on a regular basis!
