				<h3>Reservations</h3>
				<p>General Policies:</p>
				<p>
					Only one reservation will be accepted per phone call, regardless of membership status.
				</p>
				<p>
					Reservations may be made through our tee time reservation system. The starter reserves the right to
					fill open groups.
				</p>
				<p>
					Scheduled foursomes checking in for their tee time without their fourth player may opt to either
					forego that player’s spot, or have the starter assign a waiting single, or may pay in advance for
					the player who is to arrive. With the second choice, the position for that player would then be held
					open and staff would deliver the latecomer to the group. In the event the fourth player does not
					show, the fees paid for that person would have been forfeited.
				</p>
				<p>
					Groups must complete play within 4 hours 9 minutes and maintain their proper position on the course.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Patron Card holder must play in the reserved time.
				</p>

				<h3>Credit Card Numbers For Reservations</h3>
				<p>
					Amex, Visa, or MasterCard numbers will be taken when making reservations. Individuals may cancel
					reservations, without penalty, up to 24 hours in advance of the tee time. Reservations which have
					not been canceled and experience a No Show will be billed! To better serve Patron Card holders, the
					credit card number will be placed on file to eliminate additional phone time or inconvenience when
					making reservations.
				</p>

				<h3>Tee Time Policy</h3>
				<p>
					Tee times for weekdays (M-F) can be made one month in advance. Tee times for weekends and holidays
					can be made one week in advance.
				</p>

				<h3>Cash Register Receipt</h3>
				<p>
					Every player must get and carry a cash register receipt to present to the starter prior to play. The
					purchase of the receipt is an agreement to abide by the rules and policies set forth by the
					management.
				</p>

				<h3>Golf Course Users</h3>
				<p>
					All persons on the course must be at least 12 years old, possess a golf bag with at least four clubs
					and carry a valid green fees receipt. Spectators must stay on a motorized cart at all times and
					observe cart policies.
				</p>

				<h3>Golf Etiquette</h3>
				<p>
					Edinburgh USA operates the course in accordance with proper golf etiquette. This includes rules of
					play; care of course, appropriate dress and public behavior.
				</p>

				<h3>Rain Checks</h3>
				<p>
					Rain checks will be issued to players who have paid green fees but, due to bad weather (as
					determined by the golf professional or staff), are not able to complete the round. (See schedule for
					rain check policy.) Rain checks must be used for the season which they are issued.
				</p>
				<p>
					Groups that choose to begin in inclement weather will not be eligible for a rain check, unless the
					weather becomes life threatening.
				</p>

				<h3>Season Memberships</h3>
				<p>
					Season memberships are not available at Edinburgh USA.
				</p>

				<h3>Special Event Days</h3>
				<p>
					Special event days for civic groups, organizations, companies and/or tournaments will be encouraged
					but will not be organized and formulated at the expense of the golf course or city residents. Golf
					outings and fees will be determined by the professional/manager. * Mondays are generally reserved
					for outside events. Check the golf shop for specific dates.
				</p>

				<h3>Alcohol</h3>
				<p>
					No liquor, beer or food is allowed to be brought onto the premises. Coolers are not allowed on the
					golf course.
				</p>

				<h3>Golf Instruction</h3>
				<p>
					Edinburgh USA's group and private golf lessons by qualified professionals are given to properly
					promote the game of golf. Group lessons are reasonably priced to encourage residents to learn to
					play the game. For specifics, inquire at the golf shop for individual and group lesson information
					and registration.
				</p>

				<h3>Men's Club/Women's Club</h3>
				<p>
					The Men's club and Women's Club are independently organized but will follow all rules set down by
					the Edinburgh USA Golf Club and the golf professional/manager. 18 hole club membership is limited
					to Patron Card holders. For more information about various clubs, please visit their websites.
					The EMGA’s website is <a href="www.emgagolf.com">www.emgagolf.com</a>, the EWGA’s website is www.mnewga.com and the St. Andrews
					Club’s website is at <a href="www.lancercatering.com">www.lancercatering.com</a>.
				</p>

				<h3>Local Rule - Hole #17</h3>
				<p>
					The three clubs at Edinburgh USA have instituted a "local rule" for all club events.  If a player
					hits the ball into the lateral water hazard to the left of the 17th fairway, he/she may skip the
					step that requires the player to first drop the ball onto the cart path and may proceed directly to
					the right of the path taking a stance and swing relief, plus one club length.
