				<h2>Golf Basics</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>
						If you are uncertain about a rule, ask:
						<ol>
							<li>
								A fellow player
							</li>
							<li>
								Golf professional or qualified staff in the pro shop
							</li>
							<li>
								Refer to “USGA Rules of Golf”. Available for purchase in the Edinburgh Pro Shop.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>
						Summer rules are in effect unless otherwise posted and when conditions dictate.
					</li>
					<li>
						In unusual circumstances and when in need of a ruling, play another ball and keep score for both.
						Upon completion of your round and before you sign your score card, ask one of the above sources
						what the ruling is.
					</li>
					<li>
						You have 5 minutes to look for a lost ball. If you can not find it, you go back to the approximate
						location you hit it from and play another ball. You count both strokes plus add a penalty stroke
						(stroke and distance).
					</li>
					<li>
						Count all strokes including whiffs, penalties and putts. If you sign your card when there is an
						incorrect score posted, you will be disqualified from the event. Do not attest a players score
						if you know and/or another player reported an incorrect score. Corrections must be made before
						playing the next hole.
					</li>
					<li>
						There are no “gimmes” and no “mulligans”. You must play the ball into the hole to count your score.
					</li>
					<li>
						Play without delay between the green and the next tee. A player should not unduly delay play.
						Stroke play penalty is 2 strokes.  Repeated offense is disqualification.
					</li>
					<li>
						You may play honors; however, EWGA members usually play ready golf off the tee and farthest ball
						from the green first on the rest of the hole. Go ahead to your ball when it is safe to do so and
						be ready to hit when it is your turn.
					</li>
					<li>
						When playing in a hazard or bunker, you can not test the condition by touching the ground with
						your club before making your stroke. You also can not touch or move loose impediment lying in
						or touching the hazard. The penalty is 2 strokes.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>How to Play Ready Golf</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						When your group arrives at the tee box all members should be on the tee box at the same time
						with the only exception being the score keeper. Take the initiative to step up to the tee box
						immediately and hit your ball. Do not wait at your golf bag and go up one at a time.
					</li>

					<li>
						Be at your ball and ready to hit when it is your turn.
					</li>

					<li>
						Think about club selection before reaching your ball.
					</li>

					<li>
						Limit yourself to one practice swing.
					</li>

					<li>
						Walk to your own ball and prepare to hit while others go to their ball and prepare to hit.
					</li>

					<li>
						Mark your ball’s flight with a background object.
					</li>

					<li>
						Note distance, yardage, wind and obstruction before reaching your ball.
					</li>

					<li>
						If there is a chance your ball is lost or out of play, hit a provisional ball before searching.
					</li>

					<li>
						If your ball is lost, only one other person should help you look while the other players go to their ball and hit.
					</li>

					<li>
						Do not mark your ball on the green if it is not necessary.
					</li>

					<li>
						Study the line for putting while others are preparing to putt.
					</li>

					<li>
						Putt out when possible.
					</li>

					<li>
						If your group falls behind, the first two people to putt out should go to the next hole and tee off.
					</li>

					<li>
						Invite others to play through when a backup develops or a hole opens up.
					</li>
